### N-grams

[N-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) are sets of words that are commonly found together in a set of documents. This app utilizes 4-, 3-, 2-, and 1-grams (single words) to predict the next word in a sequence. These n-gram lists were generated from a training set of blog, news, and twitter documents.
