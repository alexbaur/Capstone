### Katz Back-off

What if there is no match found in the 4-gram list for the last 3 words of the input though? In that case, the last 2 words are taken and compared to the 3-gram list, just as though only 2 words had been input. If no match is found, then only the last word is compared against the 2-gram list. 

This is known as [backing-off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katz%27s_back-off_model) and allows for the predictive function to work off of its own vocabulary until it has extinguished all of its potential combinations from the source material.
