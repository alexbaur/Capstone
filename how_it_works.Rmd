### How the app predicts words

The last words of the text input are stored using Markov Chains and evaluated against n-gram tables created from a set of twitter, news, and blog text data. 

If a match is not found, the input is backed-off to a lower order n-gram and evaluated again for a match. If no matches are found from any of the n-gram tables then the unknown entry is selected from a list of the most commonly used single words.
